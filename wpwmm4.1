USAGE
.PP
You should create a \f[B]config.mk\f[] file in a directory and set the
following variables inside this file. You can use \f[I].include\f[] in your
\f[B]config.mk\f[] of course.
.SS
Basic variables
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]COMMON_DIR\f[]: Where the \f[B]00_defines.m4\f[] is. Commonly is the
same directory as \f[B]Makefile\f[].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]INCLUDE_DIR\f[]: The directory where the user\-based includes
\f[B]m4\f[] are. It's relative to the main source directory.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]SRC_DIR\f[]: This variable points to the source directory where the
source files (usually \f[B]*.m4\f[]) are. It can contain subdirectories.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]ASSETS_DIR\f[]: In this directory are the static files
(*\f[B].css\f[], *\f[B].js\f[], etc.).
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]ASSETS_DEST_DIR\f[]: The target directory of static files. If you want
inside \f[B]${DEST_DIR}\f[] should include it into this variable.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]ASSETS_CP\f[]: The command who will copy the \f[B]${ASSETS_DIR}\f[].
Default is \f[B]@cp \-r\f[].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]DEST_DIR\f[]: The compiled (created) HTML's place. The subdirectory
tree of \f[B]${SRC_DIR}\f[] is created in this directory by \f[I]make\f[].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]FLAG_DIR\f[]: The directory where the flags are. Flags are simple
files which store information about building. There is only one flag:
\f[B]${FLAG_MKDIR}\f[] which signs the time when the directory structure is
created in \f[B]${DEST_DIR}\f[] and stores the list of created directories.
You can add plus depend via \f[B]${MKDIR_REQ}\f[] \- so can re\-build the
directory structure after this file changed.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]LAYOUT_DIR\f[]: Here are the layouts.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]VIRT_DIR\f[]: This directory contains the templates of virtual pages.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]TARGETS\f[]: The space\-seperated list of static files (virtual pages
aren't included) what should create. Don't include the \f[B]${DEST_DIR}\f[]
because it's included by the building system. You can use directories of
course. Its automated requirement is the same file in \f[B]${SRC_DIR}\f[]
replacing \f[I]html\f[] extension to \f[I]m4\f[] extension.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]TARGETS_MANUAL\f[]: The space\-seperated list of static files what
should create. Don't include the \f[B]${DEST_DIR}\f[] because it's included
by the building system. These targets don't have automatically generated
requirement as the \f[B]${TARGETS}\f[] above.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]GREQ\f[]: Global requirement. It's needed by \f[I]every\f[] target.
Default is empty.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]foo.html_REQ\f[]: Additional requirements of \f[B]foo.html\f[] which
is included in \f[B]${TARGETS}\f[] variable (see above). The
\f[B]foo.m4\f[] is automatically added. These variables are optional.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]M4\f[]: The \f[I]m4\f[] command. In most cases can set simply to
\f[I]m4\f[] (in \f[I]PATH\f[]). This variable is optional, default value is
\f[I]m4\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]M4_PARAMS\f[]: Parameters of \f[B]m4\f[] command. The default value is
\f[B]\-P \-I include \-D_SRC_DIR=${SRC_DIR}\f[]. Please note that option
\f[I]\-P\f[] is neccessary because we use builtin macros with \f[B]m4_\f[]
prefix.
.SS
Variables inside sources
.PP
The following variables are created dynamically during building and you can
use them in your \f[I]m4\f[] sources and templates.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]_DIRECTORY\f[]: The target directory inside \f[B]${DEST_DIR}\f[]
(without \f[B]${DEST_DIR}\f[] prefix). The root of \f[B]${DEST_DIR}\f[] is
"." (dot).
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]_FILE\f[]: The target filename which is under generating (without any
extension).
.SS
Helpers
.PP
The system ships some helpers which you can use in your files. They are
defined in \f[B]00_defines.m4\f[]. Here is the list of helpers:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]_BODY(options,content)\f[]: Produces \f[B]<body
$options>$content</body>\f[].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]_CHARSET(charset)\f[]: Produces \f[B]<meta charset="$charset">\f[].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]_CLASS(class1,class2,...)\f[]: Produces \f[B]class="$class1 $class2
..."\f[].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]_CSS(cssfile)\f[]: Produces \f[B]<link rel="stylesheet"
href=$cssfile>\f[].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]_DIV(class,content,options)\f[]: Produces \f[B]<div class=$class
$options>$content</div>\f[].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]_HEAD(options,content)\f[]: Produces \f[B]<head
$options>$content</head>\f[].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]_HREF(url,text,options,title)\f[]: Produces \f[B]<a href=$url $options
title=$title>text</a>\f[].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]_META(parameters)\f[]: Produces \f[B]<meta $parameters>\f[].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]_OL(parameters)\f[]: Produces ordered list
\f[B]<ol><li>$1</li><li>$2</li>...</ol>\f[]. You can specify the items in
parameter list, separated by comma. Be careful about quoting!
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]_STAG(tagname,parameters)\f[]: Produces \f[B]<$tagname
$parameters>\f[].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]_TAG(tagname,content,options)\f[]: Produces \f[B]<$tagname
$options>$content</$tagname>\f[].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]_TITLE(title,options)\f[]: Produces \f[B]<title $options>$title\f[].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]_UL(parameters)\f[]: Same as \f[B]_OL\f[].
.SS
Virtuals
.PP
The virtual pages haven't source (m4) files. It's useful when you want
create similar pages with similar content (for example listing of PDF
files, listing images, ...).
.PP
You should create groups of \f[B]VIRTUALS\f[] (you can add only ONE virtual
to a group). You can do it with the following variables:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]VIRTUALS\f[]: Contains the name of the categories. E.g.
\f[B]VIRTUALS=cat1 cat2\f[]. The categories is separated by a space
character.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]VIRTUALTEMPLATE_*\f[]: You can set (following the example above)
\f[B]VIRTUALTEMPLATE_cat1\f[] and \f[B]VIRTUALTEMPLATE_cat2\f[] variables.
Their values say which template should use to generate the virtual pages.
The templates are stored in \f[B]VIRT_DIR\f[] directory. In your template
files you can use dynamically created variables, see [Variables inside
sources][] section below.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]VIRTUALDIR_*\f[]: This variable points to the target directory where
the generated pages should appear. You have to set every category, so you
have to set \f[B]VIRTUALDIR_cat1\f[] and \f[B]VIRTUALDIR_cat2\f[] too.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]VIRTUALOUT_*\f[]: The output filenames. For example
\f[B]VIRTUAL_cat1=foo1.html foo2.html\f[]. In this case you will have
\f[B]${VIRTUALDIR_cat1}/foo1.html\f[] and
\f[B]${VIRTUALDIR_cat1}/foo2.html\f[].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]VIRTUALREQ_*\f[]: Additional requirements to the virtual category. The
\f[B]${VIRTUALTEMPLATE_*}.m4\f[] is added automatically.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]VIRTUALREQRULE_*\f[]: A simple transformation rule to define a
requirement by file. The transformation rule is applied on the elements of
\f[B]${VIRTUALOUT_*}\f[] variables. For example
\f[B]VIRTUALREQ_foo=C,.html,.dat,\f[] rule will transform every
\f[B].html\f[] extension into \f[B].dat\f[] extension: the
\f[B]${DESTDIR}/foodir/bar.html\f[] will depend on \f[B]foodir/bar.dat\f[]
file. Please note that the value of **${VIRTUALDIR_*} isn't included
automatically so if you want it you should do it! Be careful about
recursive dependencies! See the possible modifiers in the manual of
\f[B]make(1)\f[]!
.SS
Hooks
.PP
You can define hooks which run at specified event. You can use the
\f[B]${.TARGET}\f[] macro in the definition because \f[I]make\f[] will
expand this variable when it needed (and not in definition). If you don't
want view the command should prefix with \f[I]@\f[] sign.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]HOOK_PRE_HTML\f[]: It runs before generating a html file from a
\f[I]m4\f[] file. Default value is \f[B]${MSG1} Building ${.TARGET}\f[].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]HOOK_POST_HTML\f[]: It runs after generating a html file from a
\f[I]m4\f[] file. Default value is empty. This hook is useful for example
if you want check the validity of HTML file (e.g. with tidy, see
http://www.html\-tidy.org/).
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]HOOK_PRE_VHTML\f[]: It runs before generating a html file from virtual
template (see [Virtuals][] above). The default value is \f[B]${MSG1}
Building virtual ${.TARGET}\f[].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]HOOK_POST_VHTML\f[]: It runs after generating a html file from virtual
template. Default value is empty.
.SS
Special targets
.PP
You can define some special targets in your **config.mk'.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]pre\-everything\f[]: This target will execute \f[I]before\f[] any
other target (except \f[I]clean\f[] of course). For example you can run a
script which creates some files, even a file what is used in wpwmm4. With
this target can emulate the tags feature (using [Virtuals][] feature).
Another idea is automatically generate the \f[B]${TARGETS}\f[] variable
(with the \f[B]find\f[] command).
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]clean\-other\f[]: When you run \f[I]clean\f[] target (which deletes
everything in \f[B]${DEST_DIR}\f[] directory) it will run too.
.SS
Information targets
.PP
There are some special targets to help debug your config.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]show\-config\f[]: Show the main variables.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]show\-hooks\f[]: Show the hooks.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]show\-targets\f[]: Show the targets (including virtual targets).
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]show\-req\f[]: Show the targets with their requirements. The target
begins a line without any whitespace, the requirements are prefixed by two
spaces. Between the latest requirement and the next target is an empty line
inserted.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]show\-virtuals\f[]: This target will show the defined virtuals and
their configs.
.SS
Generally usable variables in m4 files
.PP
There are some variables you can use and set in your \f[B]m4\f[] files.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]LANG\f[]: The document's language. It is used by \f[B]_PR_ALL\f[] to
create the main \f[B]html\f[] tag with \f[B]lang\f[] property.
.SS
Built\-in commands
.PP
There are some commands which can help. They are defined in
\f[B]00_defines.m4\f[]. Here is the list:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]_SCRIPT(command)\f[]: Executes \f[B]$command\f[] and paste its output
( \f[B]stdout\f[] and \f[B]stderr\f[] too). It uses the \f[I]m4\f[]'s
\f[B]esyscmd\f[] macro.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]_LAYOUT(layout,VarName1,Var1,VarName2,Var2,...)\f[]: Load the
\f[B]$layout\f[] layout. It uses \f[I]m4\f[]'s \f[I]include\f[] macro. You
can define the web page layout at the beginning of source file. This
command will assign the variables \f[B]VarName1\f[], \f[B]VarName2\f[],...
with values \f[B]Var1\f[], \f[B]Var2\f[].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]_LAYOUT_PRE(pre)\f[]: The \f[B]$pre\f[] is printed before the included
content.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]_LAYOUT_POST(post)\f[]: The \f[B]$post\f[] is printed after the
included content.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]_INCL(file)\f[]: Includes the \f[B]$file\f[]. The \f[I]divert\f[] is
\-1 so this macro doesn't produce any output. It's ideal to load a file
with macro definitions.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]_2_BODY(text)\f[]: The \f[B]$text\f[] will into the body tag. This
macro collects all inputs and doesn't print anything. With
\f[I]_PR_BODY\f[] can print (and clear) the content.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]_2_HEAD(text)\f[]: Same as \f[B]_2_BODY\f[] but it collects into
\f[B]head\f[] tag.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]_PR_BODY\f[]: Print and reset the content collected by
\f[B]_2_BODY\f[]. It's a simple \f[I]undivert\f[] macro.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]_PR_HEAD\f[]: Similar as \f[B]_PR_BODY\f[].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]_PR_ALL\f[]: It prints \f[B]<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="LANG">\f[],
calls \f[B]_PR_HEAD\f[] and \f[B]_PR_BODY\f[] and after it closes the
\f[B]html\f[] tag.
.SH
TIPS
.IP \[bu] 2
use of \f[B]!=\f[]: You can use \f[B]!=\f[] in \f[B]TARGETS\f[] assingment
(run a shell command and its output will the value). In this case you
shouldn't add every file, you can use the \f[B]find\f[] command (for
example). Of course can use with other variables.
